Develop the next feature using the organized specs for optimal context engineering:

**Context Selection Strategy:**
1. **Architecture & Patterns**: Use `.claude/specs/core.md` for system architecture, tech stack, and foundational patterns
2. **Development Workflow**: Use `.claude/specs/development.md` for coding standards, testing strategy, and quality gates
3. **Feature Requirements**: Use `.claude/specs/features.md` for current feature specifications and user requirements
4. **AI Integration**: Use `.claude/specs/ai-system.md` for AI agent patterns and intelligence system integration
5. **UI Implementation**: Use `.claude/specs/ui-patterns.md` for component patterns and design system guidelines

**Feature Development Process:**
1. **Analyze Requirements**: Review current feature specs and identify next priority
2. **Plan Architecture**: Use core.md patterns to design feature architecture
3. **Implement with Standards**: Follow development.md guidelines for code quality
4. **Integrate AI Intelligence**: Leverage ai-system.md patterns for AI-enhanced functionality  
5. **Apply UI Patterns**: Use ui-patterns.md for consistent, accessible user interface

**Quality Assurance:**
- Follow feature-slice architecture principles
- Ensure TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Implement proper error handling (no fallback mock data)
- Add appropriate loading states and accessibility features
- Test feature independence and event-driven communication

Think harder about the most impactful next feature based on current platform state and user value.
