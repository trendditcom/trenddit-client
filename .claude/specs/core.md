# Trenddit Core Architecture
## AI-First Intelligence Platform for Enterprise Technology Decisions

### Architecture Philosophy - AI-First Paradigm
The platform is built as an **AI intelligence system with a UI**, not a tool with AI features. Multi-agent intelligence systems collaborate to provide consultant-level insights. Each intelligence domain (Market, Business, Technical, Vendor, Risk) has specialized AI agents that can be developed, deployed, and improved independently.

### Core Intelligence Principles

#### 1. Agent Specialization & Independence
- Each AI agent specializes in one intelligence domain (Market, Business, Technical, Vendor, Risk)
- Agents can be developed, deployed, and improved independently
- Cross-agent communication through intelligent context sharing
- New agents can be added without modifying existing intelligence systems

#### 2. Continuous Learning & Improvement
- Every user interaction improves recommendations for all users
- Outcome tracking and model weight adjustment based on real-world results
- A/B testing of different AI reasoning approaches
- Kill switch for underperforming intelligence models

#### 3. Real-time Intelligence Integration
- Live data ingestion from 100+ market sources
- Function calling for real-time vendor, pricing, and competitive intelligence
- Intelligence cache for processed insights with smart invalidation
- Event-driven updates when market conditions change

#### 4. Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
- Multi-step analysis chains with causal modeling
- Transparent reasoning process for user trust
- Confidence scoring for all recommendations
- Alternative perspective generation for balanced analysis

### Technology Stack

```typescript
// AI Intelligence Layer
Primary AI: OpenAI GPT-4o (advanced reasoning, function calling, multimodal)
Multi-Agent System: Specialized agents for each intelligence domain
Chain-of-Thought: Multi-step reasoning with transparent logic
Function Calling: Real-time data integration from 100+ sources
Vector Store: Pinecone/Supabase for semantic search and embeddings
Learning Pipeline: Outcome tracking and model improvement

// Application Architecture
Framework: Next.js 14 with App Router (React Server Components)
Language: TypeScript (100% type safety)
Styling: Tailwind CSS with CVA for component variants
API Layer: tRPC for end-to-end type safety
State Management: Zustand (feature-specific stores)
Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL with real-time subscriptions)
Authentication: Clerk (enterprise-ready)
Cache: Vercel KV (Redis) for AI response caching
Analytics: PostHog (feature flags, user tracking, A/B testing)
Monitoring: Sentry (error tracking and performance monitoring)
```

### Feature-Slice Architecture

```
/features/[feature-name]/
  /components/       # UI components
  /server/          # tRPC routers
  /stores/          # Zustand stores  
  /hooks/           # Custom React hooks
  /types/           # TypeScript types
  /utils/           # Helper functions
  index.ts          # Public API exports
```

**Key Principles:**
- Each feature is completely independent and deletable
- No compile-time dependencies between features
- Communication via events only
- Shared code lives in `/lib` or `/packages`

### Event-Driven Communication

```typescript
// Features communicate via events, not direct calls
events.emit('trend.analyzed', { trendId, analysis })
events.on('trend.analyzed', async (data) => {
  // React to event
})
```

### AI Integration Patterns

```typescript
// Standard AI Agent Pattern
interface IntelligenceAgent {
  analyze(context: Context): Promise<Analysis>
  learn(outcome: Outcome): Promise<void>
  getConfidence(): number
  getReasoning(): ReasoningChain
}

// Function Calling Pattern
const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'gpt-4o',
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: prompt }],
  functions: availableFunctions,
  function_call: 'auto'
})
```

### Data Flow Architecture

```
User Input → Feature Component → tRPC Router → AI Agent → OpenAI API
                                                    ↓
Cache Layer ← Intelligence Processing ← Function Calls ← Real-time Data
     ↓
UI Update ← Event System ← Result Processing ← Confidence Scoring
```

### Performance & Scaling

- **Target Metrics**: Page load < 3s, AI response < 10s, 99% uptime
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-layer with localStorage, Redis, and CDN
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful degradation with clear user feedback
- **Monitoring**: Real-time performance tracking and alerting

### Security & Compliance

- **API Keys**: Project `.env.local` first, then user environment variables
- **Error Handling**: Transparent errors, no fallback mock data
- **Data Privacy**: User data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent API abuse and manage costs
