- **Industry specialization** with sector-specific templates and regulatory context
- **Evidence-based trend construction** with cross-reference validation
- **Credibility scoring system** with minimum 3 sources per trend
- **Data point specificity** with quantifiable metrics and market sizing

**Success Metrics**:
- 90%+ credible sources for all trends  
- Industry-specific data points in 80%+ of trends
- Average credibility score > 0.85
- Source diversity: minimum 3 different source types per trend
- User perceived credibility > 90%

**Implementation Needs**:
- Real-time data ingestion from news, financial, research, and government APIs
- Cross-reference validation and fact-checking system
- Industry-specific trend templates with regulatory implications
- Source reliability monitoring and bias detection

### UI/UX Patterns & Standards

#### Component Library Standards
- Use Tailwind CSS with consistent spacing scale
- CVA for component variants and conditional styling
- Lucide React for all icons
- Consistent color palette: blue (primary), purple (secondary), green (success), red (error)

#### Layout Patterns
```typescript
// Standard page layout
<div className="min-h-screen bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-50 via-white to-purple-50">
  <Header />
  <main className="max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-8">
    <div className="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-8">
      <div className="lg:col-span-3">{/* Main content */}</div>
      <div className="space-y-6">{/* Sidebar */}</div>
    </div>
  </main>
</div>
```

#### Interactive Elements
- Loading states with skeleton components
- Error boundaries with actionable messages
- Progressive disclosure for complex data
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach

### Feature Flag Configuration

#### Current Flags
```typescript
interface FeatureFlags {
  'trends.export': boolean
  'needs.aiGeneration': boolean
  'solutions.realTimeData': boolean
  'intelligence.dashboard': boolean
}
```

#### Rollout Strategy
- All new features start at 0% (team only)
- Progressive rollout: 5% → 25% → 50% → 100%
- Automatic rollback if error rate > 1%

### Performance Requirements

- Consistent error response shapes
- OpenAPI documentation generation
- Rate limiting and caching headers

#### Event System
Features communicate via events:
```typescript
// Standard event patterns
events.emit('feature.action', payload)
events.on('feature.action', handler)

// Example events
'trend.analyzed'
'need.generated'
'solution.recommended'
'user.profileUpdated'
```
