### Technical Requirements

#### Architecture Pattern
**Feature-Slice Architecture**: Each feature is a complete vertical slice (UI → API → DB) that can be developed, deployed, and tested independently. Features communicate via events, not direct dependencies. See `.claude/specs/plan.md` for detailed implementation.

#### Core Architecture
```
Frontend: Next.js 14+ (App Router)
Styling: Tailwind CSS + CVA (class-variance-authority)
Components: Radix UI primitives
Backend: tRPC (type-safe API per feature)
Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
Cache: Vercel KV (Redis)
AI: OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo (via Vercel AI SDK)
Auth: Clerk (simpler than Supabase Auth)
Payments: Lemon Squeezy (simpler than Stripe)
Feature Flags: PostHog
Events: EventEmitter3 + PostgreSQL event log
Analytics: PostHog + Vercel Analytics
Monitoring: Sentry
Deployment: Vercel
```

#### Data Model (Simplified)
```typescript
// Core entities - each feature owns its tables
User { id, email, company, role }
Trend { id, category, title, summary, impact_score, source }
Need { id, user_id, trend_id, statement, priority }
Solution { id, need_id, pattern, description, complexity }
TechStack { id, solution_id, components[], vendors[] }
Roadmap { id, solution_id, milestones[], timeline }

// Platform tables
Event { id, type, payload, feature, user_id, created_at }
FeatureFlag { feature, enabled, rollout_percentage, user_overrides[] }
```

#### API Integrations
- **Phase 1**: NewsAPI, Reddit API, Twitter API
- **Phase 2**: LinkedIn API (company data)
- **Phase 3**: G2 API (vendor data)
- **Phase 4**: GitHub API (tech trends)
- **Phase 5**: Jira/Asana (optional)

### UI/UX Principles

#### Design System
- **Minimalist**: Focus on content, not chrome
- **AI-First**: Natural language inputs everywhere
- **Mobile-Responsive**: Desktop-first but mobile-ready
- **Dark Mode**: Default dark with light option

#### Key Screens
1. **Dashboard**: Trend cards + quick actions
2. **Trend Explorer**: Filter, search, analyze
3. **Need Builder**: Guided wizard flow
4. **Solution Finder**: Card-based recommendations
5. **Roadmap View**: Timeline visualization

### Go-to-Market Strategy

#### Launch Sequence
1. **Week 1-2**: Friends & family alpha (5 users)
2. **Week 3-4**: Private beta (25 users)
3. **Week 5-6**: ProductHunt launch
4. **Week 7-8**: Content marketing (3 blog posts)
5. **Week 9-10**: Paid pilot program ($99/month)

#### Pricing Model
- **Freemium**: 5 trends/day, 1 roadmap/month
- **Pro**: $99/month - Unlimited + API access
- **Enterprise**: $999/month - Custom + support

### Development Principles

#### Vibe Coding Guidelines
- **Speed > Perfection**: Ship broken, fix in production
- **Copy > Create**: Use existing patterns/libraries
- **AI > Manual**: Automate everything possible
- **User > Code**: Talk to users daily
- **Revenue > Features**: Charge early and often

#### Daily Workflow
```
Morning: User feedback review (30 min)
Midday: Core feature dev (4 hours)
Afternoon: AI prompt engineering (2 hours)
Evening: Deploy + monitor (1 hour)
```

### Success Metrics

#### North Star Metric
**Weekly Active Roadmaps**: Number of AI roadmaps actively tracked by users

#### Supporting Metrics
- Time to First Value: < 5 minutes
- Trend to Roadmap Conversion: > 20%
- User Retention (Week 4): > 40%
- NPS Score: > 50
- MRR Growth: 50% MoM

### Risk Mitigation

#### Technical Risks
- **AI Hallucination**: Human-in-loop validation
- **API Costs**: Caching + rate limiting
- **Scale**: Serverless architecture

#### Business Risks
- **Competition**: Speed of execution
- **Enterprise Sales Cycle**: Start with SMBs
- **Churn**: Weekly user interviews

### Appendix

#### Competitor Analysis
- **Gartner**: Slow, expensive, not actionable
- **CB Insights**: Data-heavy, no implementation
- **Custom Consultants**: Not scalable, high cost

#### Tech Debt Budget
- Week 1-4: 0% (pure feature dev)
- Week 5-8: 20% (critical fixes only)
- Week 9-10: 30% (stability for scale)

#### Emergency Pivots
If core metrics not met by Week 4:
1. Narrow focus to single industry vertical
2. Partner with existing consultancy
3. Pivot to Chrome extension for trend capture
